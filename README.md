## ðŸ“š Getting Started

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app). 
To learn more about Expo, do look at the following resources:
- [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/): Learn fundamentals, or go into advanced topics with their [guides](https://docs.expo.dev/guides).
- [Learn Expo tutorial](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/introduction/): Follow a step-by-step tutorial where you'll create a project that runs on Android, iOS, and the web.


### Setting up the Front-end:

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Create `.env` in the root folder 

3. Add the following attributes in the .env file. You may find your ip address by running `ipconfig` in your terminal. In setting up a postgres database for the django backend, you may this website useful: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-postgresql-with-your-django-application-on-ubuntu-20-04

```
# API Endpoint
# Local device's IP address
REACT_APP_DOMAIN='your device ip address'

# DB Config
DATABASE_NAME='postgres database name'
DATABASE_USER='postgres user'
DATABASE_PASSWORD='postgres database password'
DATABASE_HOST='postgres host' 
DATABASE_PORT='postgres port'
```
An example of an .env file:
```
# API Endpoint
# Local device's IP address
REACT_APP_DOMAIN='100.100.10.10'

# DB Config
DATABASE_NAME='orbital'
DATABASE_USER='Tom'
DATABASE_PASSWORD='12345'
DATABASE_HOST='localhost' 
DATABASE_PORT='5432'
```


4. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start --tunnel
   ```

5. Scan the QR Code displayed on the terminal. If you are on IOS, use the phone camera. If you are on Android, use the Expo app's QR scanner. 


### Setting up the Back-end:

1. Activate the virtualenv for your project.
    
2. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements/local.txt
   ```
   

3. Apply the migrations:

   ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
   ```
   
4. You can now run the development server:

   ```bash
    python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
   ```
