## ðŸ“š Getting Started

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app). 
To learn more about Expo, do look at the following resources:
- [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/): Learn fundamentals, or go into advanced topics with their [guides](https://docs.expo.dev/guides).
- [Learn Expo tutorial](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/introduction/): Follow a step-by-step tutorial where you'll create a project that runs on Android, iOS, and the web.
- Required software: Python, Node Package Manager (NPM), PostgresSQL


### Setting up the Front-end:

1. Install front-end dependencies

     ```bash
   cd Frontend
   ```
   
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Create `.env` file under `Frontend` folder

3. Add the following attribute into the .env file. You may find your ip address by running `ipconfig` in your terminal or checking your phone settings 
   
   ```
   # API Endpoint
   # Local device's IP address
   EXPO_PUBLIC_DOMAIN='your device ip address'
   ```

4. Start the app 

     ```bash
   npx expo start --tunnel --clear 
   ```

5. Scan the QR Code displayed on the terminal. Alternatively, view the app on an emulator. <br>

### Setting up the Back-end:

1. Create `.env` file under root folder 

2. Add the following attributes into the .env file. (Note: In setting up a postgres database for the django back-end, you may find this website useful: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-postgresql-with-your-django-application-on-ubuntu-20-04)

   ```
   # API Endpoint
   # Local device's IP address
   REACT_APP_DOMAIN='your device ip address'

   # DB Config
   DATABASE_NAME='postgres database name'
   DATABASE_USER='postgres user'
   DATABASE_PASSWORD='postgres database password'
   DATABASE_HOST='postgres host' 
   DATABASE_PORT='postgres port'

   # One Map API Config 
   ONEMAP_EMAIL= ''
   ONEMAP_EMAIL_PASSWORD = ''
   ```

   An example of an `.env` file:
   ```
   # API Endpoint
   # Local device's IP address
   REACT_APP_DOMAIN='100.100.10.10'

   # DB Config
   DATABASE_NAME='orbital'
   DATABASE_USER='Tom'
   DATABASE_PASSWORD='12345'
   DATABASE_HOST='localhost' 
   DATABASE_PORT='5432'

   # One Map API Config 
   ONEMAP_EMAIL= 'tom@gmail.com'
   ONEMAP_EMAIL_PASSWORD = 'tom123' 
   ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment for your project. (Note: In setting up your virtual environment, you may find this website useful: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/)
    
4. Install back-end dependencies:

    ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements/local.txt
   ```
   
5. Apply the migrations:

   ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
   ```
   
6. You can now run the backend development server:

   ```bash
    python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
   ```
