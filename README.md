## ðŸ“š Getting Started

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app). 
To learn more about Expo, do look at the following resources:
- [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/): Learn fundamentals, or go into advanced topics with their [guides](https://docs.expo.dev/guides).
- [Learn Expo tutorial](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/introduction/): Follow a step-by-step tutorial where you'll create a project that runs on Android, iOS, and the web.


### Setting up the Front-end:

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Edit Frontend/config.py and change `api_endpoint` to your desired api endpoint (usually its device's IP Address)

3. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start --tunnel
   ```

4. Scan the QR Code displayed on the terminal. If you are on IOS, use the phone camera. If you are on Android, use the Expo app's QR scanner. 


### Setting up the Back-end:

1. Activate the virtualenv for your project.
    
2. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements/local.txt
   ```
    
3. Configure backend/backend/settings.py:
   - Under `DATABASES`, change to your own PostgreSQL database and user
     - To set up PostgreSQL, you can refer to this [guide](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/IDOL_12_0/MediaServer/Guides/html/English/Content/Getting_Started/Configure/_TRN_Set_up_PostgreSQL.htm) 

   - Under `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, add your local device's IP address

4. Apply the migrations:

   ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
   ```
   
5. You can now run the development server:

   ```bash
    python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
   ```
