- [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/): Learn fundamentals, or go into advanced topics with their [guides](https://docs.expo.dev/guides).
- [Learn Expo tutorial](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/introduction/): Follow a step-by-step tutorial where you'll create a project that runs on Android, iOS, and the web.
- Required software: Python, Node Package Manager (NPM), PostgresSQL


### Setting up the Front-end:

1. Navigate into `Frontend` folder. 
   > Note that all the following commands and creations are to be done in this subfolder.

   ```bash
      cd ./Frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies in the `Frontend` folder.

   ```bash
      npm install
   ```

3. Create `.env` file under `Frontend` folder

   ```bash
      touch .env
   ```

4. Add the following attribute into the .env file. 
   > If it is your first time developing mobile application, the most straight-forward way to access your back-end sever during development is to connect to localhost over the same Wifi network. You can refer to this [webpage](https://prowe214.medium.com/tip-how-to-view-localhost-web-apps-on-your-phone-ad6b2c883a7c) for more infomation.  

   ```
      # API Endpoint
      EXPO_PUBLIC_DOMAIN='your back-end domain'
   ```

   An example of an `.env` file:
   ```
      # API Endpoint
      EXPO_PUBLIC_DOMAIN='http://191.300.50.50:8000/'
   ```

4. Start the app 

   ```bash
      npx expo start --tunnel
   ```

5. Scan the QR Code displayed on the terminal. Alternatively, view the app on an emulator. <br>

### Setting up the Back-end:

1. Before setting up the back-end, you will need a [OneMap account](https://www.onemap.gov.sg/apidocs/register), [Strava account](https://www.strava.com/register/free) and a local [Postgres database](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-postgresql-with-your-django-application-on-ubuntu-20-04) set up.

2. Navigate into `./backend` folder. 
   > Note that all the following commands and creations are to be done in this subfolder.

   ```bash
      cd ./backend
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment in the `backend` folder.
   > This command will create a `venv` subfolder.

   ```bash
      python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment

   ```bash
      venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

5. Install all dependencies

   ```bash
      pip install -r ./requirements.txt
   ```

6. Create `.env` file under the ./backend folder

   ```bash
      touch .env
   ```

7. Add the following attributes into the .env file. 

   ```
      # DB Config
      DATABASE_NAME='your postgres database name'
      DATABASE_USER='your postgres user'
      DATABASE_PASSWORD='your postgres database password'
      DATABASE_HOST='your postgres host' 
      DATABASE_PORT='your postgres port'

      # OneMap API Config 
      ONEMAP_EMAIL= 'your onemap account email'
      ONEMAP_EMAIL_PASSWORD = 'your onemap account password'
      ```

      An example of an `.env` file:
      ```
      # DB Config
      DATABASE_NAME='orbital'
      DATABASE_USER='Tom'
      DATABASE_PASSWORD='12345'
      DATABASE_HOST='localhost' 
      DATABASE_PORT='5432'

      # One Map API Config 
      ONEMAP_EMAIL= 'tom@gmail.com'
      ONEMAP_EMAIL_PASSWORD = 'tom123' 
   ```

   
8. Apply the migrations:

   ```bash
      python manage.py migrate
   ```

   
9. You can now run the backend development server:

   ```bash
      python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
   ```

10. Whitelist metro's domain in Strava's callback domain field.
